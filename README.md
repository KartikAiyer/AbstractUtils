AbstractUtils
=============

Abstract Utilities to be used on small embedded systems. 

Embedded platforms are again getting a huge push with IoT, wearables and other new product technologies. Software is  typically written on systems either with with a small MCU and a little bit of SRAM or if affordable on a  system with a little more DRAM like the Raspberry Pi. On these systems, typically we want all resources to be statically allocated. 

This set of APIs provide a few abstract building tools that keep this focus in mind.
